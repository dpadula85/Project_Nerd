Input description:

The input file for this program is a plain text file. Lines starting with '#' are
ignored during the reading phase.

Each line of the input should start with a keyword among TYPE, CENTER and DIPOLE.
The keywords are case insensitive.
These keywords require a certain number of parameter after them.

TYPE:
used to define a dipole type. This keyword should be followed by 4 (5) para-
meters. The first parameter is a flag to be assigned to this dipole type. This
flag should be used to assign a dipole type when placing a dipole with the keyword
DIPOLE.
The following parameters are the Dipolar Strength, the Excitation Energy and the Damping.
(Units used normally are Kk (1 Kk = 1000 cm-1). The fourth optional parameter is to be
used only if a magnetic component is to be considered (neglect for the moment).

CENTER:
used to define a dipole application point. This keyword should be followed
by a float number f with 0. <= f <= 1 and a series of N numbers (atom indexes). The dipole
application point will be assigned to the geometrical center of the specified atoms.
If the f > 0., a weight of f will be assigned to the first atom of the series in the
calculation of the center.
All the dipoles defined after a CENTER keyword will be applied in the point defined with
this keyword.
To change application point for a new set of dipoles, leave a blank line and define a new
CENTER.

DIPOLE:
used to define the direction of a dipole of a certain TYPE applied in the previously
defined point defined through CENTER.
The first parameter to follow is the TYPE of the dipole, which should have been previously
defined with TYPE keyword. The following parameters are 2 atom indexes and, optionally, the
angle between the direction defined by the two atoms and the dipole.
