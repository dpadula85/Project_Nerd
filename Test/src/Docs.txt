This program calculates absorption and ECD spectra for multichromophoric systems
following DeVoe method.
Two input files are needed for a calculation: a structure file (accepted formats
are currently pdb, mol2 and xyz) and an input file containing dipoles definition
parameters.
The default name for these two files are respectively structure.pdb and devoe.in
but different filenames can be specified through command-line options.

###  devoe.in description  ###
##############################

A sample input is provided in devoe.in

This is a plain text file. Lines starting with '#' are ignored.

Each line of the input should start with a keyword among TYPE, CENTER and 
DIPOLE. The keywords are case insensitive.
The only rules to follow are that a DIPOLE keyword cannot be called before
a CENTER keyword. This is because dipoles defined with DIPOLE will be centered
on the CENTER above them.
Additionally, when defining a new CENTER, a blank line should be left between
this new section and the previous one.
Each keyword requires a certain number of parameters.

TYPE:
used to define a dipole type. This keyword should be followed by 4 (5) para-
meters. The first parameter is a flag to be assigned to this dipole type. This
flag should be used to assign a dipole type when placing a dipole with the 
keyword DIPOLE.
The following parameters are the Dipolar Strength, the Excitation Energy and 
the Damping. (Units used normally are D**2 for the dipolar strength and Kk
(1 Kk = 1000 cm-1) for energies.
The fourth optional parameter is to be used only if a magnetic component is to
be considered (neglect for the moment).

CENTER:
used to define a dipole application point. This keyword should be followed
by a float number W with 0 <= W <= 1 and a series of N numbers (atom indexes). 
The dipole application point will be assigned to the geometrical center of the 
specified atoms. A series of consecutive atoms can be specified with the compact
notation N1-N2. If W > 0, a weight of W will be assigned to the first atom 
of the series in the calculation of the center.
All the dipoles defined after a CENTER keyword will be applied in the point 
defined with this keyword, until a new CENTER is defined.
To change application point for a new set of dipoles, leave a blank line and 
define a new CENTER.

DIPOLE:
used to define the direction of a dipole of a certain TYPE applied in the  point
previously defined by the CENTER keyword.
The first parameter to follow is the TYPE of the dipole, which should be defined
with TYPE keyword. The following parameters are 2 or 3 atom indexes.
If only two atoms are specified, the dipole will be oriented in the direction 
from atom 1 to atom 2.
If three atoms are specified, a fourth parameter is expected, i.e. the angle 
theta the dipole forms with the plane defined by the three atoms. In this case 
the dipole will be oriented in the direction from atom 1 to atom 2, but it will 
form an angle theta with the plane defined by atoms 1-3.
