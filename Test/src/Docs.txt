Input description:

A sample input is provided in devoe.in

The input file for this program is a plain text file. Lines starting with '#' 
are ignored during the reading phase.

Each line of the input should start with a keyword among TYPE, CENTER and 
DIPOLE. The keywords are case insensitive.
These keywords require a certain number of parameters after them.

TYPE:
used to define a dipole type. This keyword should be followed by 4 (5) para-
meters. The first parameter is a flag to be assigned to this dipole type. This
flag should be used to assign a dipole type when placing a dipole with the 
keyword DIPOLE.
The following parameters are the Dipolar Strength, the Excitation Energy and 
the Damping. (Units used normally are Kk (1 Kk = 1000 cm-1). The fourth 
optional parameter is to be used only if a magnetic component is to be 
considered (neglect for the moment).

CENTER:
used to define a dipole application point. This keyword should be followed
by a float number f with 0. <= f <= 1 and a series of N numbers (atom indexes). 
The dipole application point will be assigned to the geometrical center of the 
specified atoms. If the f > 0., a weight of f will be assigned to the first 
atom of the series in the calculation of the center.
All the dipoles defined after a CENTER keyword will be applied in the point 
defined with this keyword.
To change application point for a new set of dipoles, leave a blank line and 
define a new CENTER.

DIPOLE:
used to define the direction of a dipole of a certain TYPE applied in the 
previously defined point defined through CENTER.
The first parameter to follow is the TYPE of the dipole, which should have been 
previously defined with TYPE keyword. The following parameters are 2 or 3 atom 
indexes.
If only two atoms are specified, the dipole will be oriented in the direction 
from atom 1 to atom 2.
If three atoms are specified, a fourth parameter is expected, i.e. the angle 
theta the dipole forms with the plane defined by the three atoms. In this case 
the dipole will be oriented in the direction from atom 1 to atom 2, but it will 
form an angle theta with the plane defined by atom 1, atom 2 and atom 3.
